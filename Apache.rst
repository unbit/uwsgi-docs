Apache support
===============

Currently there are three uwsgi-protocol related apache2 modules available

mod_uwsgi
---------------

This is the first developed module. It is solid, but incredibly ugly (and does not follow a lot of apache coding convention style)

``mod_uwsgi`` can be used in two ways:

* The "assbackwards" way (the default one) that is the fastest but somewhat far from the Apache2 API.
  If you do not use Apache2 filters (including gzip) for content generated by uWSGI, use this mode.
* The "cgi" mode that is somewhat slower but better integrated with Apache. To use the CGI mode, pass ``-C`` to the uWSGI server.

Options
^^^^^^^

.. note::
   
   All of the options can be set per-host or per-location.




**uWSGISocket <path> [timeout]**   Absolute path and optional timeout in seconds of uwsgi server socket.

**uWSGISocket2 <path>**            Absolute path of failover uwsgi server socket

**uWSGIServer <host:port>**        Address and port of an UWSGI server (e.g. localhost:4000)

**uWSGIModifier1 <int>**           Set uWSGI modifier1  

**uWSGIModifier2 <int>**           Set uWSGI modifier2

**uWSGIForceScriptName <value>**   Force ``SCRIPT_NAME`` (app name)

**uWSGIForceCGIMode <on/off>**     Force uWSGI CGI mode for perfect integration with apache filters

**uWSGIForceWSGIScheme <value>**   Force the WSGI scheme var (set by default to "http")

**uWSGIMaxVars  <int>**            Set the maximum allowed number of uwsgi protocol variables (default 128)


To pass custom variables you can use the ``SetEnv`` directive:

..
  
  SetEnv UWSGI_SCRIPT yourapp


mod_proxy_uwsgi
---------------


This is the newest module and probably the best bet for the future.

It is a "proxy" module, so you will get (for free) all of the futures exported by mod_proxy.

It is fully "apache api compliant" so it should be easily integrated with all of the available modules.

Using it is easy (just remember to load mod_proxy and mod_proxy_uwsgi modules in your apache config)

.. parsed-literal::

   ProxyPass /foo uwsgi://127.0.0.1:3032/
   ProxyPass /bar uwsgi://127.0.0.1:3033/
   ProxyPass / uwsgi://127.0.0.1:3031/

the first two forms set SCRIPT_NAME respectively to /foo and /bar while the last one use an empty SCRIPT_NAME.

You can set additional uwsgi vars using the SetEnv directive

You can load balance requests using mod_proxy_balancer (remember to load it)

.. parsed-literal::

   <Proxy balancer://mycluster>
      BalancerMember uwsgi://192.168.1.50:3031/
      BalancerMember uwsgi://192.168.1.51:3031/
   </Proxy>
   ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster

Pay attention to the last slash in the member/node definition. It is optional for non-empty SCRIPT_NAME/mountpoints while it is required
for apps mounted in the root of the domain.

Currently the module lacks the ability to set modifiers. It will be fixed soon.

.. note::

  If you want to use this module (and help the uWSGI project), try to report the bug you find, and do not simply
  fallback to the ancient (and ugly) mod_uwsgi

mod_Ruwsgi
----------

This is a module based on the SCGI one written by Roger Florkowski

.. note::

  This module is currently undocumented.
