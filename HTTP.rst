HTTP sockets
------------

The ``http-socket <bind>`` option will make uWSGI natively speak HTTP.

If your web server does not support the :doc:`uwsgi protocol <Protocol>` but is able to speak to upstream HTTP proxies, or if you are using a service like Webfaction or Heroku to host your application, you can use ``http-socket``.

If you plan to expose your app to the world with uWSGI only, use the ``http`` option instead, as the router/proxy/load-balancer will then be your shield.

The uWSGI HTTP/HTTPS router
---------------------------

Starting from version 0.9.6 uWSGI includes an HTTP/HTTPS router/proxy/load-balancer that can forward requests to uWSGI workers.

The server can be used in two ways, embedded and standalone.

In embedded mode, it will automatically spawn workers and setup the communication socket. In standalone mode you have to specify the address of a uwsgi socket to connect to.

Embedded mode::

  ./uwsgi --http 127.0.0.1:8080 --master --module mywsgiapp --processes 4

This will spawn a HTTP server on port 8080 that forwards requests to a pool of 4 uWSGI workers managed by the master process.

Standalone mode::

  ./uwsgi --master --http 127.0.0.1:8080 --http-to /tmp/uwsgi.sock

This will spawn a HTTP router (governed by a master for your safety) that will forward requests to the uwsgi socket ``/tmp/uwsgi.sock``.

You can bind to multiple addresses/ports.

.. code-block:: ini

  [uwsgi]
  
  http = 0.0.0.0:8080
  http = 192.168.173.17:8181
  http = 127.0.0.1:9090
  
  master = true
  
  http-to = /tmp/uwsgi.sock

And load-balance to multiple nodes:

.. code-block:: ini

  [uwsgi]
  
  http = 0.0.0.0:8080
  http = 192.168.173.17:8181
  http = 127.0.0.1:9090
  
  master = true
  
  http-to = /tmp/uwsgi.sock
  http-to = 192.168.173.1:3031
  http-to = 192.168.173.2:3031
  http-to = 192.168.173.3:3031


* If you want to go massive (virtualhosting and zero-conf scaling) combine the HTTP router with the :doc:`SubscriptionServer`.
* You can make the HTTP server pass custom uwsgi variables to workers with the ``http-var KEY=VALUE`` option.
* You can use the ``http-modifier1`` option to pass a custom `modifier1` value to workers.

HTTP Keep-Alive
---------------

If your backends set the correct HTTP headers, you can use the ``http-keepalive`` option.

Your backends will need to set a valid ``Content-Length`` in each response or use chunked encoding. Simply setting "Connection: close" is *not enough*.

Also remember to set "Connection: Keep-Alive" in your response. You can automate that using the ``add-header "Connection: Keep-Alive"`` option.

Can I use uWSGI's HTTP capabilities in production?
--------------------------------------------------

If you need a load balancer/proxy it can be a very good idea. It will automatically find new uWSGI instances and can load balance in various ways.

If you want to use it as a real webserver you should take into account that serving static files in uWSGI instances possible, but not as good as using a dedicated full-featured web server.

If you host static assets in the cloud or on a CDN, using uWSGI's HTTP capabilities you can definitely avoid configuring a full webserver.

.. note:: If you use Amazon's ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) in its HTTP mode in front of uWSGI in HTTP mode, a valid ``Content-Length`` *must be set* by the backend.
