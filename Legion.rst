The uWSGI Legion subsystem (1.9-dev)
====================================

Starting from uWSGI 1.9-dev a new subsystem for clustering has been added: The Legion subsystem.

A Legion is a group of uWSGI nodes constantly fighting for domination.

Each node has a valor (different from the others, if possible). 

The node with the higher valor is the Lord of the Legion (or if you like a more engineer-friendly term: the master)

This constant fight generates 5 kind of events:

1. setup - when legion subsystem is started on a node
2. join - the first time quorum is reached, only on the newly joined node
3. lord - when node becomes a lord
4. unlord - when node loses the lord title
5. death - when legion subsystem is shuting down

You can trigger actions every time such an event rises, and this should switch-on the light on your brain...

Still confused ?
****************

An example, as always is the best approach for learning:

Ip Takeover
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is probably the king of all of the example, as this is a very common needs in clustered environments.

The ip address is a resource that must be owned by only one node (i suppose you know what could happens otherwise...).

That node is our Lord.

If we configure a Legion right (remember, a single uWSGI instances can be a member of all of the legions you need) we
could easily implement ip takeover.

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]

   legion = clusterip 225.1.1.1:4242 98 bf-cbc:hello
   legion-node = clusterip 225.1.1.1:4242

   legion-lord = clusterip cmd:ip addr add 192.168.173.111/24 dev eth0
   legion-lord = clusterip cmd:arping -c 3 -S 192.168.173.111 192.168.173.1

   legion-setup = clusterip cmd:ip addr del 192.168.173.111/24 dev eth0
   legion-unlord = clusterip cmd:ip addr del 192.168.173.111/24 dev eth0
   legion-death = clusterip cmd:ip addr del 192.168.173.111/24 dev eth0

In this example we join a legion named 'clusterip'. To receive messages from the other nodes we bind on (multicast) address
225.1.1.1:4242. The valor of this node will be 98 and each message will be encrypted using blowfish cbc with the secret 'hello'.

The 'legion-node' option specify the destination of our announce messages. As we are using multicast we only need to specify a single node.

The last options are the actions to trigger on the various state of the cluster. For an ip takeover solution we seimply rely on iproute commands
to set/unset ip addresses and to send gratuitous arp.

Obviously this specific example requires root privileges or CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, so be sure to not run applications on the same instance
managing ip takeover.


The Quorum
**********

To choose a Lord each member of the legion has to cast a vote. When all of the active members of a legion agree on a Lord, the Lord is elected (and the old Lord degraded).

Every time a new node joins or leaves a legion the quorum is re-computed and logged to the whole cluster.

Choosing the Lord
*****************

Generally the node with the higher valor is choosen as the Lord, but there can be cases where different nodes have the same valor.
When a node is started a UUID is assigned to it. If two nodes with same valor are found the one with the lexycographically higher UUID wins

Split brain
***********

Even if each member of the Legion has to send a checksum of its internal cluster-membership (no quorum is reached if not all nodes have the same checksum)
the system is still vulnerable to the split brain problem. If a node lose network connectivity with the cluster, it could believe it is the only node available and starts
going in Lord mode.

For some scenario this is bad, so if you have more than 2 nodes in a legion you may want to consider tuning the quorum level.
The quorum level is the amount of votes (from different nodes) to receive needed to elect a lord. 

You can reduce the split brain problem asking the Legion subsystem to check for at least 2 votes:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]

   legion = clusterip 225.1.1.1:4242 98 bf-cbc:hello
   legion-node = clusterip 225.1.1.1:4242

   legion-quorum = clusterip 2

   legion-lord = clusterip cmd:ip addr add 192.168.173.111/24 dev eth0
   legion-lord = clusterip cmd:arping -c 3 -S 192.168.173.111 192.168.173.1

   legion-setup = clusterip cmd:ip addr del 192.168.173.111/24 dev eth0
   legion-unlord = clusterip cmd:ip addr del 192.168.173.111/24 dev eth0
   legion-death = clusterip cmd:ip addr del 192.168.173.111/24 dev eth0


The legion-quorum is the option for the job

Actions
*******

Each one of the four phases of a legion (setup,death,lord,unlord) can trigger an action. The actions system is modular so you can
add new kind of actions.

Currently the supported actions are:

cmd:<command>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

run a shell command

signal:<num>
^^^^^^^^^^^^

raise a uWSGI signal

log:<msg>
^^^^^^^^^

log a message

For example you could combine the log action with the alarm subsystem to have cluster monitoring for free...

Multicast, broadcast and unicast
********************************

Even if multicast is probably the easiest way to implement clustering (without additional efforts when you add/remove nodes) it is not available
in all networks.

If multicast (or broadcast) is not available for you, you can rely on normal ip addresses. Just bind to an address and add all of the legion-node options you need:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]

   legion = mycluster 192.168.173.17:4242 98 bf-cbc:hello
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.22:4242
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.30:4242
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.5:4242

This is for a cluster of 4 nodes (myself + 3 nodes)

Multiple Legions
****************

You can join multiple legions in the same instance. Just remember to use different addresses (ports in case of multicast) for each legion

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]

   legion = mycluster 192.168.173.17:4242 98 bf-cbc:hello
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.22:4242
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.30:4242
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.5:4242

   legion = mycluster2 225.1.1.1:4243 99 aes-128-cbc:secret
   legion-node = mycluster2 225.1.1.1:4243

   legion = anothercluster 225.1.1.1:4244 91 aes-256-cbc:secret2
   legion-node = anothercluster 225.1.1.1:4244

Security
********

Each packet sent by the Legion subsystem is encrypted using a specified cypher, a preshared secret and an optional IV (for some cipher the IV could be required).

To get the list of supported ciphers, run **openssl enc -h**.

Remember: each node of a Legion has to use the same encryption parameters !!!

To specify the IV just add another parameter to the **legion** option

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]

   legion = mycluster 192.168.173.17:4242 98 bf-cbc:hello thisistheiv
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.22:4242
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.30:4242
   legion-node = mycluster 192.168.173.5:4242

To reduce the impact of replay-based attacks (an external node sending an exact copy of a sniffed packet), packets with a timestamp lower
than 30 seconds are rejected. This could be not enough in high-security environment, so you can tune it (see next section).
If you have no control on the time of all of the nodes you can increase the clock skew tolerance (see next section again)


Tuning and Clock Skew
*********************

Currently there are three parameters you can tune (globally for all of the legions). The frequency (in seconds) at which each packet is sent (**legion-freq <secs>**), the amount of seconds
after a node not sending packets is considered dead (**legion-tolerance <secs>**), and the amount of seconds of difference in time received from nodes (**legion-skew-tolerance <secs>**, always synchronize all of your nodes with ntp or something similar)

By default each packet is sent every 3 seconds, and a node is considered dead after 15 seconds, while a clock skew of 30 seconds is tolerated (decreasing skew tolerance will increase security against replay attacks)

Lord scroll (coming soon)
*************************

In the current shape the Legion subsystem can be used for a lot of purposes (from master election to auto-nodes discovery or simple monitoring) but having
the possibility to assign a "blob of data" (a scroll) to every node will open to a lot of new possibilities. You could use that blob
to pass reconfiguration parameters to your app, or to log specific messages.

Currently the scroll system is being discussed on, so if you have ideas join our mailing-list or irc channel

Api
***

You can know if the instance is a lord of a Legion by simply calling 

.. code-block:: c

   int uwsgi_legion_i_am_the_lord(char *legion_name);

it returns 1 if the current instance is the lord for the specified Legion

The python plugins exposes it via the uwsgi.i_am_the_lord(name) function

The psgi plugin exposes it via uwsgi::i_am_the_lord(name)

The rack plugin exposes it as UWSGI::i_am_the_lord(name)

Obviously more api functions will be added in the future, feel free to expose your ideas.

Stats
*****

The Legion infos are exported in the :doc:`StatsServer`

Be sure to understand the difference between "nodes" and "members". Nodes are the peer you configure with the **legion-node** option
while members are the effective nodes that joined the cluster.

The old clustering subsystem
****************************

During 0.9 development cycle a clustering subsystem (based on multicast) has been added. It was very raw, unreliable and very probably no-one used it seriously.
The new idea is transforming it in a general api that can use different backends. 

The Legion subsystem can be one of those backends, as well as projects like corosync or the redhat cluster suite.
