uWSGI internal routing
======================

``Updated to 1.9``

Since uWSGI 1.9, a programmable internal routing subsystem is available (older releases have it, but with lot less features)

You can use the internal routing subsystem to dinamically alter the way requests are handled. For example you can
use it to trigger a 301 redirect on specific urls, or to serve content from the cache on specific conditions.

The internal routing subsystem is inspired by Apache mod_rewrite and Linux iptables command.

Please, before blasting it for being messy, not-elegant nor turing-complete, remember that it must be FAST and only FAST.
If you need elegance, do that (slowly) in your code.

The internal routing table
**************************

The internal routing table is a sequence of ''rules'' executed one after another (forward jumps are allowed too).

Each rule is composed by a ''subject'', a ''condition'' and an ''action''

The ''condition'' is generally a PCRE regexp applied to the subject, if it matches the action is triggered. Subjects are request's variables.

Currently the following subjects are supported:

* host (check HTTP_HOST)
* uri (check REQUEST_URI)
* qs (check QUERY_STRING)
* remote-addr (check REMOTE_ADDR)
* referer (check HTTP_REFERER)
* user-agent (check HTTP_USER_AGENT)
* default (default subject, maps to PATH_INFO)

In addition to this a pluggable system of lower-level conditions is available.

You can access this system using the ``--route-if`` option.

Currently the following checks are supported:

* exists (check if the subject exists in the filesystem)
* isfile (check if the subject is a file)
* isdir (check if the subject is a directory)
* isexec (check if the subject is an executable file)
* equal/isequal/eq/== (check if the subject is equal to the specified pattern)
* startswith (check if the subject starts with the specified pattern)
* endswith (check if the subject ends with the specified pattern)
* regexp/re (check if the subject matches the specified regexp)
* empty (check if the subject is empty)

When a check requires a pattern (like with 'equal' or 'regexp') you split it from the subject with a semicolon:

.. code-block:: ini

   ; never matches
   route-if = equal:FOO;BAR log:never here
   ; matches
   route if = regexp:FOO;^F log:starts with F


Actions, are the functions to run if a rule matches. This actions are exported by plugins and have a return value

Action's return value
*********************

Each action has a return value, that value tell the routing engine what to do next.

The following return codes are supported:

* NEXT (continue to the next rule)
* CONTINUE (stop scanning the internal routing table and run the request)
* BREAK (stop scanning the internal routing table and close the request)
* GOON (continue to the next rule with an action plugin different from the current one)

When a rule does not match, NEXT is assumed

The first example
*****************

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route-user-agent = .*curl.* redirect:http://uwsgi.it
   route-remote-addr = ^127\.0\.0\.1$ break:403 Forbidden
   route = ^/test log:someone called /test
   route = \.php$ rewrite:/index.php
   route = .* addheader:Server: my uWSGI server
   route-host = ^localhost$ logvar:local=1
   route-uri = ^/foo/(.*)\.jpg$ cache:key=$1.jpg
   route-if = equal:${PATH_INFO};/bad break:500 Internal Server Error

The previous rules, build the following table:

* if the HTTP_USER_AGENT var contains 'curl' redirect the request to http://uwsgi.it (code 302, action returns BREAK)
* if the REMOTE_ADDR is '127.0.0.1' returns a 403 Forbidden (action returns BREAK)
* if the PATH_INFO starts with /test print the string 'someone called /test' in the logs (action returns NEXT)
* if the PATH_INFO ends with '.php' rewrite it to /index.php (action returns NEXT)
* for all of the PATH_INFO add the HTTP header 'Server: my uWSGI server' to the response (action returns NEXT)
* if HTTP_HOST is localhost add the logvar 'local' setting it to '1'
* if REQUEST_URI starts with /foo and ends with .jpg get it from the uWSGI cache using the supplied key (built over regexp grouping) (action returns BREAK)
* if the PATH_INFO is equal to /bad throws a 500 error

Accessing request vars
**********************

In addition to pcre placeholders/groups (using $1 to $9) you can access request variables (PATH_INFO, SCRIPT_NAME, REQUEST_METHOD...)
using the ${VAR} syntax

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route-user-agent = .*curl.* redirect:http://uwsgi.it${REQUEST_URI}
   route-remote-addr = ^127\.0\.0\.1$ break:403 Forbidden for ip ${REMOTE_ADDR}

Accessing cookies
*****************

You can access a cookie value using the ${cookie[name]} syntax:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/foo log:${cookie[foobar]}

this will log the content of the 'foobar' cookie of the current request

Accessing query string items
****************************

You can access the value of the QUERY_STRING using the ${qs[name]} syntax:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/foo log:${qs[foobar]}

this will log the content of the 'foobar' item of the current request's QUERY_STRING

Pluggbale routing vars
**********************

Both the cookie and qs vars, are so called "routing vars". They are pluggable, so external plugin can
add new vars to add new features to your application.

Check the :doc:`GeoIP` for an example

There are a series of embedded routing vars, this is a list updated to 20130422:

mime, returns the mime type of the specified var: ${mime[REQUEST_URI]}

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/images/(.+) addvar:MYFILE=$1.jpg
   route = ^/images/ addheader:Content-Type: ${mime[MYFILE]}

time, returns time/date in various form. The only supported (for now) is time[unix] returning the epoch

math, requires matheval support. Example: math[CONTENT_LENGTH+1]

base64, encode the specified var in base64

hex, encode the specified var in hex

uwsgi, return internal uWSGI infos, uwsgi[wid] and uwsgi[pid] are currently supported


Is not --route-if enough ? Why --route-uri and friends ?
********************************************************

This is a good question. You just need to always remember that uWSGI is about versatility and PERFORMANCE. Gaining cycles
is always good. The --route-if option, albeit versatile, cannot be optimized, all of its parts has to be recomputed at every request.
This is obviously very fast, but --route-uri option (and friends) can be pre-optimized (during startup) to directly map to the request memory areas, so
if you can use them, just use them ;)


GOTO
****

Yes, the most controversial construct of the whole information technology industry (and history) is here. You can make forward jumps (only forward !!!)
to specific points of the internal routing table. You can set labels to mark specific point of the table, or if you are brave (or fool)
directly the rule number (rule number are printed on server startup, but please use labels...)

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]

   route-host = ^localhost$ goto:localhost
   route-host = ^sid\.local$ goto:sid.local
   route = .* last:
  
   route-label = sid.local
   route-user-agent = .*curl.* redirect:http://uwsgi.it
   route-remote-addr = ^192\.168\..* break:403 Forbidden
   route = ^/test log:someone called /test
   route = \.php$ rewrite:/index.php
   route = .* addheader:Server: my sid.local server
   route = .* logvar:local=0
   route-uri = ^/foo/(.*)\.jpg$ cache:key=$1.jpg
   route = .* last:

   route-label = localhost
   route-user-agent = .*curl.* redirect:http://uwsgi.it
   route-remote-addr = ^127\.0\.0\.1$ break:403 Forbidden
   route = ^/test log:someone called /test
   route = \.php$ rewrite:/index.php
   route = .* addheader:Server: my uWSGI server
   route = .* logvar:local=1
   route-uri = ^/foo/(.*)\.jpg$ cache:key=$1.jpg
   route = .* last:

The example is like the previous one, but we make tiny differences between domains. Check the use of "last:", that interrupt
the routing table scan.

Obviously (or not ?) you can rewrite the first 2 rules as one:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]

   route-host = (.*) goto:$1

Apache mod_rewrite inspired rewrite engine. Rebuild PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING accordingly to the specified rule

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route-uri = ^/foo/(.*) rewrite:/index.php?page=$1.php

rewrite-last
^^^^^^^^^^^^

alias for rewrite but with a return value of CONTINUE

uwsgi
^^^^^

return value: BREAK

plugin: router_uwsgi

Rewrite the modifier1 and modifier2 values of a request or route the request to an external uwsgi server

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/psgi uwsgi:127.0.0.1:3031,5,0

route all of the requests starting with /psgi to the uwsgi server running on 127.0.0.1:3031 setting modifier1 to 5 and modifier2 to 0

If you only want to change the modifiers without routing the request to an external server use the following syntax

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/psgi uwsgi:,5,0

you can even set a specific UWSGI_APPID value

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/psgi uwsgi:127.0.0.1:3031,5,0,fooapp

The request is async-friendly (engine like gevent, or ugreen are supported) and if offload threads are available they will be used.

http
^^^^

return value: BREAK

plugin: router_http

route the request to an external http server

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/zope http:127.0.0.1:8181

you can specify an alternative Host header with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/zope http:127.0.0.1:8181,myzope.uwsgi.it

static
^^^^^^

return value: BREAK

plugin: router_static

serve a static file from the specified path

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/logo static:/var/www/logo.png

basicauth
^^^^^^^^^

return value: GOON (NEXT on failed authentication)

plugin: router_basicauth

four syntaxes are supported

* basicauth:realm,user:password – a simple user:password mapping
* basicauth:realm,user: – only authenticates username
* basicauth:realm,htpasswd – use a htpasswd-like file. All POSIX crypt() algorithms are supported. This is _not_ the same behavior as Apache’s traditional htpasswd files, so use the -d flag of the htpasswd utility to create compatible files.
* basicauth:realm, – Useful to cause a HTTP 401 response immediately. As routes are parsed top-bottom, you may want to raise that to avoid bypassing rules.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   route = ^/foo basicauth:My Realm,foo:bar
   route = ^/foo basicauth:My Realm,foo2:bar2
   # The following rule is required as the last one will never match and an HTTP 401 would never be triggered
   route = ^/foo basicauth:My Realm,
   route = ^/bar basicauth:Another Realm,kratos:

Example: using basicauth for Trac

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   ; load plugins (if required)
   plugins = python,router_basicauth

   ; bind to port 9090 using http protocol
   http-socket = :9090

   ; set trac instance path
   env = TRAC_ENV=myinstance
   ; load trac
   module = trac.web.main:dispatch_request

   ; trigger authentication on /login
   route = ^/login basicauth:Trac Realm,pippo:pluto
   route = ^/login basicauth:Trac Realm,foo:bar

   ;high performance file serving
   static-map = /chrome/common=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/trac/htdocs

basicauth-last
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

same as basicauth but returns CONTINUE on successfull authentication

ldapauth
^^^^^^^^

This auth router is part of ldap plugin, build and load this plugin to use it.
Same as basicauth router, but uses LDAP server for authentication, syntax:

ldapauth:realm,options

Avaiable options:

* url - LDAP server URI (required)
* binddn - DN used for binding, set if LDAP server does not allow anonymous searches
* bindpw - password for binddn user
* basedn - base DN used when searching for users (required)
* filter - filter used when searching for users (default is "(objectClass=*)")
* attr - LDAP attribute that holds user login (default is "uid")
* loglevel - 0 - don't log any binds, 1 - log authentication errors, 2 - log both successful and failed binds

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

   route = ^/protected route-run = ldapauth:LDAP auth realm,url=ldap://ldap.domain.com;basedn=ou=users,dc=domain;binddn=uid=proxy,ou=users,dc=domain;bindpw=password;loglevel=1;filter=(objectClass=posixAccount)
