.. _PythonAppDict:

Application dictionary
----------------------

You can use the application dictionary mechanism to avoid setting up your application in your configuration.

.. code-block:: python

  import uwsgi
  import django.core.handlers.wsgi

  application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

  def myapp(environ, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])
    yield 'Hello World\n'

  uwsgi.applications = {
    '': application,
    '/django': 'application',
    '/myapp': myapp
  }


Passing this Python module name (that is, it should be importable and without the ``.py`` extension) to uWSGI's ``module`` / ``wsgi`` option, uWSGI will search the ``uwsgi.applications`` dictionary for the URL prefix/callable mappings.
  
The value of every item can be a callable, or its name as a string.

.. TODO: Where is the string looked up from?

.. _Virtualenv:

Virtualenv support
------------------

`virtualenv`_ is a mechanism that lets you isolate one (or more) Python applications' libraries (and interpreters, when not using uWSGI) from each other.
Virtualenvs should be used by any respectable modern Python application.

.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org/

Quickstart
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create your virtualenv::

    $ virtualenv myenv
    New python executable in myenv/bin/python
    Installing setuptools...............done.
    Installing pip.........done.

2. Install all the modules you need (using `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ as an example)::

    $ ./myenv/bin/pip install flask
    $ # Many modern Python projects ship with a `requirements.txt` file that you can use with pip like this:
    $ ./myenv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Copy your WSGI module into this new environment (under :file:`lib/python2.{x}` if you do not want to modify your ``PYTHONPATH``).
  
  .. note:: It's common for many deployments that your application will live outside the virtualenv. How to configure this is not quite documented yet, but it's probably very easy.
  .. TODO: Document that.

  Run the uwsgi server using the ``home``/``virtualenv`` option (``-H`` for short)::

    $ uwsgi -H myenv -s 127.0.0.1:3031 -M -w envapp


.. _PythonPaste:

Paste support
-------------

If you are a user or developer of Paste-compatible frameworks, such as Pylons and Turbogears or applications using them, you can use the uWSGI ``--paste`` option to conveniently deploy your application.

For example, you have a virtualenv in :file:`/opt/tg2env` containing a Turbogears app called ``addressbook`` configured in :file:`/opt/tg2env/addressbook/development.ini`::

  uwsgi --paste config:/opt/tg2env/addressbook/development.ini --socket :3031 -H /opt/tg2env

That's it! No additional configuration or Python modules to write.

.. warning::

  If you setup multiple process/workers (:term:`master` mode) you will receive an error::

    AssertionError: The EvalException middleware is not usable in a multi-process environment

  in which case you'll have to set the ``debug`` option in your paste configuration file to False -- or revert to single process environment.
