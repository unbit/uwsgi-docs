Welcome to uWSGI's documentation!
=================================

uWSGI is a fast, self-healing and developer/sysadmin-friendly application container server coded in pure C.

Born as a WSGI-only server, over time it has evolved in a complete stack for networked/:doc:`clustered<Clustering>` web applications, implementing :doc:`message/object passing<CustomRouting>`, :doc:`caching<Caching>`, :doc:`RPC` and :doc:`process management<ProcessManagement>`.

It uses the :doc:`uwsgi<Protocol>` protocol for all the networking/interprocess communications. The :doc:`Nginx<Nginx>` and :doc:`Cherokee<Cherokee>` servers natively support the uwsgi protocol. Modules are available for other popular servers, including :doc:`Apache<Apache>`. uWSGI can also speak other protocols, such as :doc:`HTTP<HTTP>`, ZeroMQ for :doc:`Mongrel2` and :doc:`FastCGI`.

uWSGI can be run in preforking, threaded, :doc:`asynchronous/evented<Async>` and :doc:`green thread/coroutine<GreenThread>` modes. Various forms of green threads/coroutines are supported, including :doc:`uGreen`, Greenlet, Stackless, :doc:`Gevent` and :doc:`FiberLoop`.

Sysadmins will love it as it can be :doc:`configured via several methods<Configuration>`, including command line, environment variables, XML, INI, YAML, JSON, SQLite and LDAP.

On top of all this, it is designed to be fully modular. This means that different plugins can be used in order to add compatibility with tons of different technology on top of the same solid core.

To get started with uWSGI, take a look at the :doc:`Install` page. Then continue to :doc:`Quickstart` or if you are feeling daring, the :doc:`Options` page. Some example configurations are available on the :doc:`Examples` page.

.. note::

  With a large open source project such as uWSGI the code and the documentation may not always be in sync.
  The mailing list is the best source for help regarding uWSGI.
