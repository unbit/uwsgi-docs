The uWSGI project
=================

The uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for building (and hosting) clustered/distributed network applications.

Mainly targeted at the web and its standards, it has been successfully used in a lot of different contexts.

Thanks to its pluggable architecture it can be extended without limits to support more platforms and languages. Currently, you can write plugins in C, C++ and Objective-C.

The "WSGI" part in the name is a tribute to the namesake Python standard, as it has been the first developed plugin for the project.

Versatility, performance, low-resource usage and reliability are the strengths of the project (and the only rules followed).

Included components (updated to latest stable release)
======================================================

The Core (implements configuration, processes management, sockets creation, monitoring, logging, shared memory areas, ipc, cluster membership and the SubscriptionSystem)

Request plugins (implement application server interfaces for various languages and platforms: WSGI, PSGI, Rack, Lua WSAPI, CGI, PHP, Go ...)

Gateways (implement load balancers, proxies and routers)

The :doc:`Emperor <Emperor>` (implements massive instances management and monitoring)

Loop engines (implement concurrency, components can be run in preforking, threaded, asynchronous/evented and green thread/coroutine modes. Various technologies are supported, including uGreen, Greenlet, Stackless, :doc:`Gevent <Gevent>`, Goroutines and Fibers)

.. note::

  With a large open source project such as uWSGI the code and the documentation may not always be in sync.
  The mailing list is the best source for help regarding uWSGI.
