The uWSGI project
=================

uWSGI is an extremely advanced, sysadmin-friendly, highly-modular **application container server** written in POSIX-compatible C.

It can communicate with your front-end webserver via `HTTP <HTTP.rst>`_, FastCGI, ZeroMQ and its highly specified/optimized protocol named 'uwsgi' (all-lowercase) already supported out-of-the-box by a lot of webservers.

Born as a simple WSGI-only server, over time it has evolved in a complete stack for networked/:doc:`clustered<Clustering>` web applications, implementing :doc:`message/object passing<CustomRouting>`, :doc:`caching<Caching>`, :doc:`RPC` and :doc:`process management<ProcessManagement>`.

uWSGI can be run in preforking, threaded, :doc:`asynchronous/evented<Async>` and :doc:`green thread/coroutine<GreenThread>` modes. Various forms of green threads/coroutines are supported, including :doc:`uGreen`, Greenlet, Stackless, :doc:`Gevent` and :doc:`FiberLoop`.

Sysadmins will love it as it can be :doc:`configured via several methods<Configuration>`, including command line, environment variables, XML, INI, YAML, JSON, SQLite and LDAP.

Thanks to its pluggable architecture it can be extended without limits to support more platforms and languages. Currently, you can write plugins in C, C++ and Objective-C

To get started with uWSGI, take a look at the :doc:`Install` page. Then continue to :doc:`Quickstart` or if you are feeling daring, the :doc:`Options` page. Some example configurations are available on the :doc:`Examples` page.

.. note::

  With a large open source project such as uWSGI the code and the documentation may not always be in sync.
  The mailing list is the best source for help regarding uWSGI.
